# Simple Inline Injection Tool (SILI tool)
## Disclaimer
Layers of Wax gets deposited on internal wall of crude oil pipeline. This causes the pipe to choke up and the entire section of the pipe has to be removed. This costs too much to oil comapnies and a solution is required to find profile of wax deposition.

## Solution
The code above generates a 3D internal view of crude oil pipeline. The tool consists of various sensors and stores the data in a CSV file.
The software uses `mplot3d`library in python. The program also has a very intuitive GUI.
